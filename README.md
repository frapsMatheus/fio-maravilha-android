Fio Maravilha is a famous barbershop from Brasilia, Brazil. I was contracted as a freelancer to build their apps (Android and iOS) and the apps backend/database. 

The app was designed by Raphael Henrique and it's design was highlighted by Adobe.
[Adobe post about the app](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/02/16/meet-the-designer-raphael-henrique.html#gs.ccehs2)

The app is a scheduling solution where the users can create an appointment at the barbershop. The barbershop can then manage their appointments using an admin solution created in React. Both solutions are integrated through a database using [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/). The main features of the app are:

1. A newsfeed
2. Pick multiple services
3. Pick a barber
4. Pick a date and a time
5. Push notifications 
6. Cancel your current scheduled appointments
7. Login (it had login with facebook but the owner decided to remove it)
